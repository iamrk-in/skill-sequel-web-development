          <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

          <p>
            Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that
            the age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it
            yourself,” can be a two-way street.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
            internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a
            great website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an
            ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you
            have to pick your battles.
