            Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that
            the age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it
            yourself,” can be a two-way street. Of course, there are companies
            out there that have great web writers internally, but most don’t.
            And the thought of a company turning a great website content
            strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective “brochure site”
            gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your battles.
