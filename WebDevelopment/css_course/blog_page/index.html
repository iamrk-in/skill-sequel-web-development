          <h3>Website content template components</h3>
          <p>
            Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that
            the age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it
            yourself,” can be a two-way street.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
            internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a
            great website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an
            ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you
            have to pick your battles.
          </p>

          <p>
            In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins,
            we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that
            gives them a fighting chance to produce effective website content
            that drives action. Here is a template we like to use, and an
            explanation of what’s included.
