      <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

      <p class="style_my_para">
        Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
        age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,”
        can be a two-way street.
      </p>

      <h4>Businesses and organizations</h4>

      <ul id="get_style focus_listItem">
        <li>AirTran Airways (IATA airline code), defunct American airline</li>
        <li>
          FL Group, an Icelandic investment company with an emphasis on flight
          and tourism industry
        </li>
        <li>Foot Locker (ticker symbol), retailer</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Numismatics</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>Florin (disambiguation), various coins</li>
        <li>Guilder, various coins also sometimes called "florin"</li>
      </ol>

        Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
        internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
        website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective
        “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your
        battles.

        Before starting any given page, you really need to wrap your heads
        around the primary goal of the page and to whom this page is targeted.
        <br />
        What’s their pain? <br />
        What’s in it for them? <br />
        Where are they in their buying process? <br />
        And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for
        your solution? <br />
        The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes
        and write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that
        buyer.
