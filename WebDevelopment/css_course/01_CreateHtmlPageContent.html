      <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

      <p>
        Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
        age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,”
        can be a two-way street.

        Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
        internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
        website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective
        “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your
        battles.

      <p>
        <strong>Pre-writing questions:</strong> Before starting any given page,
        you really need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page
        and to whom this page is targeted. <br />
        What’s their pain? <br />
        What’s in it for them? <br />
        Where are they in their buying process? <br />
        And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for
        your solution? <br />
        The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes
        and write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that
        buyer.
