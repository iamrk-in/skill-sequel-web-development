    <h4>CSS Specificity</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>CSS Specificity:</strong> refers to the set of rules that
      determines which styles are applied when they are conflicting or
      ovelapping style declaration.
    </p>

      final rendering of an element is determined
    </p>

    <p>
      CSS Specificity is based on the combination of different selectors used in
      a style rule. Each selector carries a certain weight and the selector with
      higher specificity. The specificity is calculated based on the following
      criteria:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Inline Styles:</strong> Styles defined directly on an HTML
        element using the `style` attribute. They have high specificity
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ID's:</strong> Seletors targeting elements by their unique ID
        attibute using the symbol `#`. They have a higher specificity than
        classe's and tag's
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Classe's, Attributes and PsuedoClasse's:</strong> Selectors
        targetng elements based on Class Names, Attributes, PsuedoClasses. They
        have the lowest specificity
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Elements and PsuedoElements:</strong> Selectors targeting
        elements based on their TagName's (eg., div, p) or PsuedoElements (eg.,
